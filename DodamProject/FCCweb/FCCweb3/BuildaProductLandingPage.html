 "Hanbok" (also called "joseonot") is a collective term for traditional Korean clothing. Though there have been slight changes in hanbok over time in terms of material, preferred colors, and the length of the skirt or jacket, the hanbok's basic format has more or less remained the same for the past 1,600 years. </p>

  Hanbok can be classified into ceremonial and everyday dress, each of which can be further classified by gender, age and season. All types of hanbok are created beautifully through combinations of straight and slightly curved lines. Women's hanbok in particular are recognized worldwide for the simple yet delightful harmony of their short jackets and full skirts. The jacket, which is put on one arm at a time, makes the upper body look very small, while the skirt worn wrapped around the waist makes the lower body look full, creating an attractive balance. The cut and drape of the clothing complements not only the Korean female physique but also flatters and fits most other body types as well.
 <br> <br>
  The unique lines of hanbok appear at their greatest when the wearer is in motion. Hanbok is creative and expressive in its design. Another special feature about hanbok is the shape, having a slim top and wide bottom, similar to a bell. The jacket should be tight and fitted while the skirt is relaxed. The tightly fitting jacket attractively reflects the shape of the upper body. The wide sleeves and flexible skirt flatter the wearerâ€™s gracefulness by hiding the movements of the lower body, so the wearer appears to be floating on air. Hanbok fabric is colored using natural dyes. The colors of nature are imbued in the cloth, giving hanbok a depth and richness not found from artificial dyes.

A woman's hanbok is typically two-piece (a high skirt and petticoat) with a long-sleeved top. The ensemble was traditionally paired with a headpiece and special footwear, but now a smartphone and running shoes are more common accessories. <br><br>
  
Hanbok designs are still largely bespoke and picking one out typically begins at a fabric store. Companies like Leesle, however, which brands itself "Korea's everyday hanbok company," have replaced traditional tie-ups with zippers and made their skirts machine washable and less bulky for everyday wear. <br><br>
The French fashion giant Chanel looked to traditional South Korean dress for its 2015 cruise collection, which designer Karl Lagerfeld unveiled in Seoul last May. 

Drawing inspiration from the clothes of the Chosun dynasty, which ran from 1392 to 1910, Lagerfeld told reporters after the show that he "loved traditional Korean clothes, materials and patterns" and that the timing of the show, Chanel's first in South Korea, was just "the right moment to do it." <br><br>
Many will be familiar with Korean pop music, or at least the term K-pop, with Psy's Gangnam Style (still the most-viewed video on YouTube ever) representing Korea's latest musical mass export. Makeup is another.

South Korea's skin-care market, collectively known as "K-beauty" in North America, is already well-established and highly profitable.

Last year K-beauty-related exports amounted to a record $2.6 billion US, according to a BBC business report. The bulk of those exports were to the U.S.
