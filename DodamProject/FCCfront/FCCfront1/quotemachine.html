However, most of us know that Easter isn't simply a ­commercial festival about dyeing and hiding eggs or wearing new spring attire.",
"Easter is the Christian observance of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and his resurrection days later. It's the central festival of the Christian church and, after the Sabbath, it's the oldest Christian observance. ",
"Unlike festivals such as Christmas, Easter has been celebrated without interruption since New Testament times",
"If you l­ive outside the UK, you probably haven't heard of Shrove Tuesday. But you probably know it by its other name, Mardi Gras. Pancakes were originally eaten o­n Shrove Tuesday -- the Tuesday before Lent -- to use up eggs and fat before the fast of Lent. Today, these pancakes are generally made of eggs, milk and flour. The word <shrove> comes from <shrive> meaning  <the confessions of sins> -- something done in preparation for Lent.",
"Ash Wed­nesday is a day of fasting that gets its name from the practice of sprinkling ashes over those engaging in the fast of Lent. Has anyone ever apologized to you by saying, <Let me put on my ashes and sackcloth...> This is where that saying originated."];
